# Advanced Internet Computing WS 2021 - Group 4 Topic 2

This template is intended to serve as an *example* on how you might want to structure the README when submitting your project.

**Important**: The specific subdirectories are *not* meant to be extended but to serve as an example on how to write a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file. Your first task should be to replace them with your own.

## How to run

### Development

#### Installing dependencies

In order to develop on the application make sure you have `npm 7` or higher installed.
Then run `npm install` in the main directory. This will automatically install all node modules.

When installing a new dependency use the command `npm install dependency -w service`.

#### Docker

In order to start all services run `docker-compose up` in order to start the application in development mode.

To stop the containers run `docker-compose stop` or delete them by running `docker-compose down`.

When installing a new dependency you will need to rebuild the docker container with `docker-compose build container-name`.
