# Advanced Internet Computing WS 2021 - Group 4 Topic 2

This template is intended to serve as an *example* on how you might want to structure the README when submitting your project.

**Important**: The specific subdirectories are *not* meant to be extended but to serve as an example on how to write a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file. Your first task should be to replace them with your own.
